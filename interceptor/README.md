# Interceptor microservice
 
Interceptor is a simple, fast, and reliable service for receiving messages using different paradigms:
 - Consumer-Producer via subscribing to topics
 - Receiving messages from a queue 

Interceptor will retrieve messages from an AWS SQS queue and persist this data in a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy.
